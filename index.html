            What is the purpose of this workshop?
          </h2>
          <p>The primary goal of the workshop is to bring together WebVR stakeholders to identify unexploited opportunities as well as technical gaps in WebVR authoring.</p>
          <p>Participants in the workshop will:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Share good practices and novel techniques in creating WebVR-based content,</li>
            <li>Discuss existing and foreseen challenges in using WebVR to deploy content and services in specific usages,</li>
            <li>Contribute to the unification of efforts for documenting and advocating the development of WebVR content.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We won't just be listening to presentations, but we will be actively participating in breakout sessions and working discussions covering <a href="#topics">topics identified as relevant to the participants</a>.
          </p>
          <h3 id="why-the-web">
            How is the Web a viable platform for VR?
          </h3>
          <p>The Web provides a promising preexisting ecosystem for the creation, distribution, and experiencing of VR content, applications, and services.</p>
          <p>In leveraging the Open Web Platform, we hope to provide an interoperability to avoid fragmentation and duplicated effort.</p>
          <p><a href="https://webvr.info/">WebVR/<a> provides an API that enables the creation and distribution of VR content in browsers.</p>
          <h2 id="attend">
            How can I attend?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Attendance is <b>free</b> for all invited participants and is open to the public, whether or not W3C members.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you wish to express interest in attending, please fill out the <a class="todo" href=""><b>registration form</b></a>. We want to fill the room with people with practical experience of authoring WebVR content and with people involved in the evolution of WebVR as a technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the venue can accommodate unfortunately only <span class="todo">N</span> attendees, you must receive an acceptance email in order to attend. Also, be sure to keep an eye on <a href="#dates"><b>these important dates</b></a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an alternative to the registration form, you are encouraged to
            submit a topic in the form of a <a href="#position-statements"><b>position statement</b></a>.
          </p>
          <p>Our aim is to get a diversity of attendees from a variety of industries and communities, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>VR content producers and distributors</li>
            <li>VR experience designers and artists</li>
            <li>3D, VR and WebVR authoring tools and platforms</li>
            <li>authors of WebVR content</li>
            <li>experts in challenges and opportunities of VR for people with disabilities</li>
            <li>browser vendors</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This workshop, as other W3C meetings, operates under its <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

            How can I suggest a presentation?
          </h2>
          <p>
            This is a workshop, not a conference, and any presentations will be short, with topics suggested by submissions and decided by the chairs and program committee. Our goal is to actively discuss topics, not to watch presentations.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to best facilitate informed discussion, we encourage attendees to read the accepted topics prior to attending the workshop.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you wish to present on a topic, you can send us a position statement at &lt;<a href="mailto:team-vr-submission@w3.org">team-vr-submission@w3.org</a>&gt; by the deadline (see <a href="#dates"><b>important dates</b></a>). Our <a href="committee">program committee</a> will review the input provided, and select the most relevant topics and perspectives.
          </p>
          <p>
            A good position statement should be a few paragraphs long and should include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your background in the development of WebVR content,</li>
            <li>Which topic you would like to lead discussion on,</li>
            <li>Links to related supporting resources.</li>
            <li>Any other topics you think the workshop should cover in order to be effective.</li>
            <li>Position statements must be in English, preferably in HTML or plain-text format; images should be included inline in HTML using base64-encoded data URIs. You may include multiple topics, but we ask that each person submit only a single coherent position statement. The input provided at registration time (e.g., bio, goals, interests) will be published and linked to from this workshop page.</li>

            What is W3C?
          </h2>
          <p>
            W3C is a voluntary standards consortium that convenes companies and
            communities to help structure productive discussions around existing
            and emerging technologies, and offers a Royalty-Free patent framework
            for Web Recommendations. We focus primarily on client-side (browser)
            technologies, and also have a mature history of vocabulary (or
            “ontology”) development. W3C develops work based on the priorities of
            our members and our community.

              Becoming a Sponsor
            </h3>
            <p>
              W3C Workshops, meetups, and other events bring you into direct
              contact with leading Web technology experts: representatives from
              industry, research, government, and the developer community.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether your interests are focused on a particular topic being
              discussed by a Working Group, or you wish to reach a diverse
              international audience setting, your sponsorship will help
              your organization engage W3C&#39;s participants in its strategic direction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sponsorships offset a portion of our meeting costs, so W3C welcomes
              multiple sponsors for each event. All proposals for sponsorship are
              subject to W3C approval.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you&#39;re interested in being a sponsor of the W3C Web &amp; Virtual
              Reality Workshop, please contact J. Alan Bird, Global Business
